                    <p>Like the phrase &#171;stem cell&#187; itself, &#171;stem cell therapy&#187; is&#160;often used to&#160;describe a&#160;variety of&#160;different medical therapies that utilize stem cells in&#160;some form to&#160;treat a&#160;patient. Sometimes the term is&#160;used incorrectly to&#160;refer to&#160;platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections. The term is&#160;also used to&#160;refer to&#160;stem cell transplants, also known as&#160;bone marrow transplants.

                        Most commonly &#171;stem cell therapy&#187; is&#160;used to&#160;describe a&#160;procedure where the patient&#8217;s adult stem cells and other potentially regenerative cells are harvested from a&#160;tissue sample of&#160;either fat or&#160;bone marrow taken from the patient. These concentrated regenerative cells are then used to&#160;treat specific injuries typically by&#160;injecting them into the afflicted area. It&#160;should be&#160;said that this type of&#160;stem cell therapy is&#160;currently not FDA approved and clinics performing it&#160;illegally in&#160;the US&#160;or&#160;in&#160;other countries perform various versions of&#160;the procedure to&#160;treat illnesses and injuries with little to&#160;no&#160;clinical evidence.

                        At&#160;InGeneron we&#160;use the term &#171;regenerative cell therapy&#187; since there are many different cell types and regenerative properties collected and used by&#160;our therapy along with adult stem cells. Importantly we&#160;do&#160;not treat patients outside of&#160;our approved clinical trials and we&#160;are dedicated to&#160;securing FDA approval through rigorous clinical testing.</p>
